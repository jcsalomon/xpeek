`xpeek`: Define commands that peek ahead in the input stream
============================================================

The `xpeek` package provides tools to help define commands that,
like [`\xspace`][1], peek at what follows them in the command stream
and choose appropriate behavior.

The code is adapted from an answer posted to [TeX.SX][2] by
Enrico “egreg” Gregorio at <http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/59542/2966>,
with modifications according to suggestions & contributions by
Enrico, Joseph Wright, Bruno Le Floch, & Clemens Niederberger;
see <http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/63568/2966>.
